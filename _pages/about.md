<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a master student who is majoring in applied cryptography and federated learning at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. Specifically, my research interest includes the following aspects. Additionally, I have done some work that combines homomorphic encryption with federated learning and you can see them in <a href='https://github.com/Vageous'>my github</a>. Meanwhile, I have published some papers in some conferences and journals including IEEE ICC, IEEE Globecom, and IEEE IoTj. Now, I have begun to learn more about functional encryption, zero-knowledge proof, and blockchain. In the future, I will do some work on the above aspects.
